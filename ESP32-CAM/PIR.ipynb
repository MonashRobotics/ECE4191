    "#### This short tutorial demonstrate how to use a PIR sensor with ESP32-CAM. The ESP32-CAM flash LED shall flash upon motion detected by the PIR sensor. The datasheet of the specific PIR sensor (EKMC2608111K) we offer can be found [here](https://www.farnell.com/datasheets/4379415.pdf?_gl=1*1aysx48*_gcl_au*OTQ4NjM5NTYxLjE3NTEzNDY5ODM.). If you're unsure how to program a ESP32-CAM, check out the page [here](https://lastminuteengineers.com/getting-started-with-esp32-cam/)."
