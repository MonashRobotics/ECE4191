The datasheet of the TCS3425 serises can be found [here](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/TCS34725.pdf). In this tutorial, we will show how to setup the a Timer on Nucleo-L432KC to output a PWM, and use the on-board LED to show the PWM."

    "We are going to use GPIO and the Timer `TIM1` (see [STM32 datasheet](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32l432kb.pdf) page 38/156 Table 9) to generate a PWM with a desired frequency. To set the Timer frequency, we first need to set the HCLK frequency and determine the correct Prescaler to use for the Timer. Open the `.ioc` file in your project and click on the `Clock Configuration` tab to check the clock setting of the STM32.\n",

Assume that we want the Timer to run at $10$ Hz, we can set the `APB2 timer clocks (MHz)` to $0.5$ MHz, then set a prescaler of $50000$ for the TIM1. (i.e., TIM1 frequency = $0.5e6/50000=10$ Hz.)

    "Go to the `Pinout & Configuration` tab, under `Timers`, select `TIM1`. Set the `Clock Source` to `Internal Clock`. Set the `Channel 1` to `PWM Generation CH1`. In the Configuration, set the `Prescaler` to $50000-1$. (The `Prescaler` value will be $n+1$ where $n$ is the number you enter.) Set `auto-reload preload` to `Enable`, which allows the Timer to reset the counter after it finishes the current round. This way, the Timer will run continuously without interruption, smoothly transitioning from the end of one period to the beginning of the next. In the `Pinout review` window, you should now have `PB3` as a `GPIO_Input` by default, and `PA8` labelled as `TIM1_CH1` for the output of `TIM1` from Channel 1. (There is a chance that your IDE picks a different pin for TIM1_CH1, in this case, change the corresponding hardware and software configurations.)\n",

    "Let's assume we want to generate a PWM with a period of $1$ s and a duty cycle (DC) of $50$%, we can set `ARR` to $10$ and `CRR` to $5$. In this way, each PWM preiod is $10$ Timer preiod ($1/10*10=1$ s). And for the first $5$ Timer preiod, the Timer channel 1 outputs a `HIGH` (And the rest `LOW`), which achieves a DC of $50$%.\n",
